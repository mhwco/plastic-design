# Plastic Design

## Introduction

Plastic Design is a cross-platform, epoch-making interface design standard. With Plastic Design, developers can demonstrate superior results in a simple way, allowing people to concentrate on writing without having to worry about interface design. Plastic Design is an open source project that uses the MIT license, meaning that you can use it for free, modify it (as long as you comply with the license), and even work with us to make it better.

## Get Started

You don't need to understand the mechanics of Plastic Design, or even understand what CSS and JS are. Just insert this piece of code into the head tag of your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://mhwco.github.io/plastic-design/enkaryotes.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://mhwco.github.io/plastic-design/jellyfish.css"/>
<script src="https://mhwco.github.io/plastic-design/pd-reflect.js"></script>
```
